# VGUI.css

CSS Classic Green VGUI Skin from early Steam and Goldsource games, with a black variant.

To use, install the `styles` folder onto your server, and add the `<link>` line to your HTML file, changing the path if necessary.

See `demo_greensteam.html` for example usage. Semantics are exactly the same for blacksteam.

To edit the styles, use [`lessc`](http://lesscss.org/usage/) on specific files or leave the [less-watch-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less-watch-compiler) process running: `less-watch-compiler --main-file greensteam/greensteam.less styles styles`, in the root folder.
